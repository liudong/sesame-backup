As stated in the document of OWLim (http://owlim.ontotext.com/confluence/display/OWLIMv35/BigOWLIM+Administrative+Tasks#BigOWLIMAdministrativeTasks-Restoringtherepositoryafteracrash): "There is no facility at present to back up a repository while it is running. Therefore, to backup a repository it must be shutdown gracefully and a copy of its storage directory (and any sub-directories) taken." This small tool aims at implementing the automatic bakcup of Sesame repositories in a simple way, i.e. dumping the repositories in the format of TriG. If setting up a cron task, the backup of Sesame repositories can be done automatically.
